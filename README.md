Here I have created the analysis model of a Super market datasheet given by the company and have deployed the parameters successfully.

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● All business problems you can derive by exploring the data.
Also compared the profits in the areas on different items.
